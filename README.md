Project analyzes the offensive performance of top goal scorers across Europe's major football leagues in the 2022/23 season. By examining metrics like goals, expected goals (xG), and shot efficiency, the project aims to rank players and uncover hidden top performers. Using statistical methods like linear ordering and cluster analysis, it identifies distinct player profiles and provides insights into their goal-scoring capabilities beyond simple goal tallies.
